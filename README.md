## ABOUT THE PROJECT

    Hi! We are Alvaro and Robert,

    and we have generated a fictitious business model about a small dental clinic.


    We have created a database where we can store the data of a customer, 
    
    a dentist and an appointment. Also, you can create, update, 
    
    get, and delete this data if you want.


    Finally, you can make a dental appointment and generate a user login.

    
    NOTE: If you want to play with our database, 
    
    you will need to know the following sequelize commands:


    sequelize db:migrate                        Run pending migrations
    sequelize db:migrate:schema:timestamps:add  Update migration table to have timestamps
    sequelize db:migrate:status                 List the status of all migrations
    sequelize db:migrate:undo                   Reverts a migration
    sequelize db:migrate:undo:all               Revert all migrations ran
    sequelize db:seed                           Run specified seeder
    sequelize db:seed:undo                      Deletes data from the database
    sequelize db:seed:all                       Run every seeder
    sequelize db:seed:undo:all                  Deletes data from the database
    sequelize db:create                         Create database specified by configuration
    sequelize db:drop                           Drop database specified by configuration
    sequelize init                              Initializes project
    sequelize init:config                       Initializes configuration
    sequelize init:migrations                   Initializes migrations
    sequelize init:models                       Initializes models
    sequelize init:seeders                      Initializes seeders
    sequelize migration:generate                Generates a new migration
